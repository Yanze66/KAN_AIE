# KAN_AIE
This project aims to develop KAN on spatial computing architecture. 

In the KAN-C-SRC folder, I orchestrated KAN using C code. It is not as accurate as the official KAN, but it contains the basic ideas, e.g., activation, pruning, and search functions.

In the KAN-aie folder, I upload components of KAN. But to build the system, you may need to follow the tutorial of Vitis-AIE.
